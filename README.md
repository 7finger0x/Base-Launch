BaseLaunch: Mini App Discovery & Launch
Platform
Research-Driven Development for the Base Ecosystem
Executive Summary
Research Findings
Key Pain Points Identified
1. Discovery Problem (CRITICAL)
Users don't know what apps exist [1]
Hard to find relevant mini apps [2]
Apps need minimum usage thresholds to appear in search [3]
Information scattered across platforms [4]
Source: Noice app case study, Jesse Pollak
Successful launches follow a specific pattern, but most developers don't know it. The "Noice playbook"
that Jesse highlighted includes:
Problem: Most developers lack these tools and don't know this playbook exists.
Source: Jesse Pollak's Farcaster posts
Jesse earned ~$30k in one week just from posting on Base app and is using it all to back creators.
However, this earning mechanism isn't accessible to most creators yet.
Opportunity: Build infrastructure for broader creator monetization.

> "If your app isn't interesting enough, people will flip back to TikTok or YouTube."
Apps need compelling reasons for users to return daily/weekly, not just one-time visits.

3. Monetization Gaps (HIGH)
4. User Retention (HIGH)
